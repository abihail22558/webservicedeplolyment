## Project Overview
This project details a **network discovery and vulnerability assessment** using the open-source tool **Nmap**. The primary aim was to identify active hosts, open ports, services, and operating systems within a local network and evaluate potential vulnerabilities.

---

## Objectives
1. Perform a **basic network scan** using Nmap.
2. Identify **active hosts** within the specified network.
3. Detect **open ports** and the associated **services** running on each host.
4. Conduct **operating system (OS) detection** to assess potential vulnerabilities.

## Methodology
The scan was conducted on the **92.168.56.1/24 subnet**, following these steps:

1. **Determine Network Range**:
   - Command: `ipconfig`  

2. **Network Discovery**:
   - Command: `nmap -sn 92.168.56.1/24`  

3. **Port and Service Scan**:
   - Command: `nmap -sV 92.168.56.1/24`  

4. **Operating System Detection**:
   - Command: `nmap -O 92.168.56.1/24`

## Results
The scan identified **256 IP addresses**, with **22 active hosts**. Below are key highlights:

### Example Host Analysis:
- **Host 1**:  
  - **IP**: 92.168.56.1  
  - **Status**: Up  
  - **Open Ports**:
    - 22/tcp – SSH  
    - 80/tcp – HTTP  
    - 443/tcp – HTTPS  
  - **OS**: Linux 2.6.32 - 3.10  

- **Host 3**:  
  - **IP**: 92.168.56.45  
  - **Status**: Up  
  - **Open Ports**:
    - 21/tcp – FTP  
    - 22/tcp – SSH  
    - 80/tcp – HTTP  
    - 443/tcp – HTTPS  
  - **OS**: Linux 2.6.32 - 3.10  

- **Host 10**:  
  - **IP**: 92.168.56.117  
  - **Status**: Up  
  - **Open Ports**: None  
  - **OS**: Fortinet Fort iOS 6.X|7.X  

- **Host 16**:  
  - **IP**: 92.168.56.241  
  - **Status**: Up  
  - **Open Ports**:
    - 1443/tcp – IES-LM  
    - 4444/tcp – krb524  
    - 8443/tcp – HTTPS-ALT  
  - **OS**: One Access 1641 Router  

---

## Key Insights
- A total of **22 active hosts** were identified, many with open ports and services that could be exploited.  
- Detected operating systems included **Linux**, **macOS**, **FreeBSD**, **Fortinet FortiOS**, and **VoIP phones**.  
- Further analysis is recommended for hosts with critical open ports like **443 (HTTPS)**, **22 (SSH)**, and **80 (HTTP)** to address potential vulnerabilities.
